We are shifting from vsphare 5.5 to vmware java automatic sdk 6.5 which is completely different from vijava api's.

We are searching api's in 6.5 but not finding properly.. so can you provide me steps to connect vcenter, list vm's, list host's, get datastore's and creating vm step by step?

Otherwise write tutorial on your www.vThinkBeyondVm.com portal, so we can refer that and it will be helpfull to many more peoples.
